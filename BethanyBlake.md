# Application
Throwing my hat in the ring last minute. I don't have a lot of software design experience beyond cs240 at this point. I'm a data science emphasis, which is what most of my electives have focused. So I've quite a good bit of work with python and R for class data projects. I've had limited experience with SQL. I did take web programming a while back, so I have a general familiar with html/css, React, Node, Angular, etc. I have a lot of epxerience using AWS. 

## Bolts
Business: I run operations for a cleaning company in Provo that handles cleaning checks for several apartment complexes. We use google forms to submit photos of areas that fail their checks. One of the biggest complaints we get from our clients is that the google drive folders the photos get stored into have such limited options for sorting and accessing photos. Depending on the progression of this app, I have about a dozen or so monthly users that could do beta testing for us. If this is something that you're considering developing past this semester, I'd have about 70-80 users that will be needing to store photos when we do turnover cleaning in August. 

Operations: First of all I think this just looks like a cool project. If you have any long-term operations, in addition to helping with software development for this project, I've done a lot to create the business model, as well as our billing and payroll system for this cleaning company. I also have experience working for an online financial literacy startup here in Provo, handling salesforce administartion. Plus experience with business devleopment and sales. So beyond the scope of this class, if you end up doing something with this, I have a very random, broad business knowledge base if you want a good contact.

Legal: I think the only legal concern I have is of course around data privacy and security for photos. I know a little bit about the legal aspect of a Utah, LLC too.

Technical: I agree with your technical priorities. 
Somewhere you had mentioned being able to add comments to photos. I think it would also be really useful to be able to add tags or labels for photos that would allow users to more easily organize and sort your photos. 

Social: Small businesses are always looking for affordable, easy to use business solutions. When you get into a tight-knit, local industry like rental properties, there's a lot of chattering and networking that goes on behind the scenes. Just an alternative if you're looking for something to get you started beyond just trying to attract attention on social media or whatever.
