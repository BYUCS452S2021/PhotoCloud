As an android user I often get left out of the pictures because I can’t airdrop! 
Nor do I have the best camera, so I often never take the pictures and consequently 
never get the pictures on my phone. This app would directly benefit me but also many
other families and friends. I have a solid background in front end and back-end
development and could contribute on all fronts. I am comfortable with relational 
databases and look forward to using a NoSQL database. I’m assuming we’d be making 
an android/iphone application and I am familiar with Xamarin forms which uses a 
code-once, and deploy twice method where the logic compiles to Java for Android
and Swift for Iphone. If every member of the group has Android then I’d prefer to 
just use Android studio.
