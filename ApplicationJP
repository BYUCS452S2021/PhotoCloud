Hello, I’m James Peterson,

I think that your photo storage application seems intriguing, and potentially fun to work with. I have some front end and back end experience, 
although not intensive, and have a grasp of the basic concepts behind them. I’m interested in seeing how the photo storage process works with the database information here.
Commenting on the Aspects they asked us to in the assignment

Business: Your format looks good. I wonder how professional you are hoping for the app to look by the end of the semester (I’m not sure it will quite reach those goals). 
The break down below though seems feasible (be able to have groups with picture, save new ones, comment on them, etc, and save between folders. It reminds me a bit of 
the twitter application from 340 – so it might be a good idea to start with some basic low level data/goals that are most critical and then work on adding extra features 
from there as time allows).

Operations: Seems fun, if it gets big enough for that, that would be interesting.

Legal: Again, interesting. I probably don’t have too much interest in working on it past the scope of the class if that is something important for your consideration. 
(So, if you want help building it but don’t want to share the glory, I’m your man). Yeah, but in all seriousness, if your looking for long term partners, then I’ll probably 
not be able to fill that niche.

Technical: I agree with your technical priorities. They seem feasible and well thought out.

Social: The social looks good too. The hardest part is getting your initial user base, so as we continue, thinking about/discussing that could be important.
