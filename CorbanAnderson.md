# Application

I would be interested in working on this project because I have definitely had this problem in the past. I'm also interested in this project because I could see it being a cool social app (we'd need a killer UI) but if it was like a totally public dynamic bucket where someone could get all of the pictures into a public college that people share from a large event like at a rock concert or something. I've had experience working with postgres and with mongodb. But I also have experience with cloud tools including AWS EC2 servers, S3, and various web technologies including React, Vue, and Angular. I also have experience with Nodejs. If you would be interested in letting me work on this project please feel free to email me at corban@corbanha.com

## Bolts
- Business
   - The business options look good, you've obviously put some thought into this and that's good. We'll want to validate these various tiers
- Operation
   - This looks good, a Chief Marketing officer and an advertising specialist would probably also be really helpful too.
- Legal
   - And if you legit want a Utah LLC I have experience I have a couple Utah LLC's that I've created personally
- Technical
   - The technical direction looks good, if this were a real product we'd want to do more validation on the domain name and work with potential customers during the development phase.
- Social
   - Socials look good, yeah I think word of mouth will be key. We'll also want to make it really easy to use for people who don't have an account that way normal people using the app will get their friends to use it too
