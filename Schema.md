this is what i was thinking


User (user_id, name, address, other stuff)
Folder(folder id, name,owner_id, date,)
FolderContents(folder id, phicture_id) or replace picture id with picture file and get rid of picture tabel
FolderShareGroup(folder id, user_id)

picture(picture id, picture_file, picture info such as caption or something)
