# PhotoCloud

Sample Project: Photo Sharing App

Please consider joining my team: [PhotoCloud](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1arxBSdeSU4iEx7boIH8jhol7mHtADI2BA7QNn8lueZ8/edit?usp=sharing)

Have you ever been on a vacation with your family, or attended a special event, or any other kind of situation where you weren't the primary photographer? Remember those times where you had to constantly ask for the pictures to be sent to you, only to wait for weeks before receiving them (or maybe not even receiving them at all)? Remember those times Airdrop failed you when sending too many files at once? Well, those days are **gone**!

PhotoCloud is here to make sharing pictures and videos from those special moments amongst you and your favorite individuals more easily and accessible. With PhotoCloud, you can create your own personal groups, where you can invite others to be part of your group, and you can all collectively "dump" your images and videos there. You can also save them to your own phone or to a personal folder inside the app, share comments in the photos themselves and even share your favorite emojis on how you feel about them! 

### Let's make PhotoCloud a reality by helping others not only capture their favorite moments but also by helping them share them. :camera_flash: :cloud:
